### Activity 5.2
#### Contents
This repository contains the following Python program:
1. **compute_sales.py:** A tool for computing the total prices from a products dictionary. (Handing JSON files).

#### Folder structure
This repository contains a folder structure to organize the results (*on a txt file*) for each of the Test Cases applied for each of the programs. This is to ensure easy access and reference to the outcomes of different executions.
NOTE: Some of the TC results folders include two outputs: one with handling negative quantity values and another one without following this procedure.

Additionally, a video has been included. This video demonstrates the execution of each program and provides a detailed explanation of the logic behind their implementation.
